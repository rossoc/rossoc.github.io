= Open Source: an opportunity for Europe

Open Source projects offer a compelling model for sharing software and fostering
collaboration. Europe has both the opportunity and the necessity to invest Open
Source development.
*Such investments can enhance European software ecosystem, drive innovation,
and lead to technological sovereignty.*

== What is Open Source?

Open Source means that the source code of a library or application is freely
available for use, modification, and distribution. While users can utilize the
software as they see fit, there are different licenses that preserve the
author's rights and outline specific obligations. These licenses help maintain
a balance between freedom of use and intellectual property protection.

== Benefits of Open Source

Open Source projects allow companies to share common libraries, fostering
collaboration and reducing redundancy.
Instead of multiple companies independently developing libraries that solve the
same problem, they can contribute to a single Open Source project.
This collaborative approach:

- *Saves Resources*: by reducing decoupled development effort.
- *Accelerates Innovation*: ready to use and accessible software boosts startups.
- *Enhance AI*: building great amount of top quality software to train AIs on.

== European Repositories Platform

+ We need a *European platform to host Open Source software*. We cannot rely on
  platforms like GitHub or Mercury to publish national software.
+ We need to follow Switzerland's initiative
  #footnote()[#link("https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software.html#")]:
  *all government software that has no security risk has to be disclosed and
  published openly*.
+ We need to invest on Open Source software to foster the European software
  environment. Thus, *we need to invest on software that cuts the greatest
  amount of expenses for European companies*.

== Maintainers

While Open Source projects are often shared among many contributors, managing
their development can be challenging. To address this, *I propose that Europe
funds deserving Open Source projects*.
The maintainers' responsibilities includes:

- *Ensuring safety*: Dependencies have to be risk-free and up-to-date.
- *Maintaining the Library*: Develop and improve the libraries following the
  issues#footnote()[In computing, the term "issue" is a unit of work to
    accomplish an improvement in a system. An issue could be a bug, a requested
    feature, task, missing documentation, and so forth.].
- *Updating Documentation*: All documentation must be reliable and accessible.

== Funding Mechanism

Inspired by Spotify's method of compensating creators, Open Source projects
should receive funds based on the level of engagement from European companies.
Two possible approaches are:

+ *Issue-Based Funding*: Projects receive funds proportional to the number of
  issues opened by European companies.
+ *Voting System*: Companies have votes proportional to their number of
  employees or other metrics. They can vote for the projects or issues they
  want to be solved.

Why Is This a Good Idea?

- *Alignment with Demand*: Funding is directed toward projects and issues that
  are most relevant to the needs of European companies.
- *Fair Resource Allocation*: Companies with greater usage and reliance on Open
  Source projects have a proportionate influence on funding decisions.
- *Incentivizes Quality and Responsiveness*: Maintainers are motivated to
  address the most pressing issues, improving overall software quality.

== Why shall we develop an European platform?

Developing a European platform to manage these projects offer benefits:

- *Intellectual Property Protection*: Ensures that software is available for
  research while preserving the intellectual property rights of European
  contributors.
- *Independence*: Reduces reliance on a private company that may have
  conflicting interests (Open Source is fundamentally hosted on GitHub a
  platform owned by Microsoft).
- *AI Research*: Great amount of top quality software is available to European
  companies to investigate and develop AI.

== How can the funds be used?

Since Europe would be investing in these projects, it has the right to
establish clear and definitive license agreements. For example, we can impose
for the software to be fully disclosed, when there is not any security concern.
Furthermore, we can adapt research and development processes to the new need
very expensive need: software maintenance.

// == Preventing Monopolies in Open Source Projects
//
// There is a risk that European companies might dominate the development of
// Open Source projects they fund, similar to how global companies like Google,
// Meta, or Microsoft influence Open Source projects to meet their needs.
// To prevent this:
//
// - *Develop a Robust Voting System*: Create a transparent and fair system that
//   balances the interests of all stakeholders.
// - *Ensure Diverse Representation*: Include input from small and
//   medium-sized enterprises, public entities, and individual contributors.
// - *Set Governance Policies*: Establish rules that prevent any single entity
//   from having disproportionate control over a project's direction.

== Conclusion

*Investing in Open Source is in Europe's best interest*.
This benefits public entities, foundations, private citizens, and most
importantly European companies.
By strengthening the European software ecosystem, Europe can:

- *Optimize Resource Allocation*: Incrementing products' value rather than
  developing redundant libraries.
- *Foster Tech Culture*: Encourage innovation and collaboration across the
  continent.
- *Conquer European Sovereignty*: Building high quality software to train
  AIs, instead of relying on foreign technologies.

In summary, a strategic investment in Open Source projects can drive significant
advancements in Europe's technological capabilities, benefiting the entire
society.
